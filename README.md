# housing-price
Implementing neural networks regression to predict housing price. The dataset is taken from http://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.
I have implement two Neural Networks with different layers, one is with 3 layers and other is with 5 layers. And I compare accuracy with each other.
